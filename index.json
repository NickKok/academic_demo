CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in stages, at centre-of-mass energies of 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV, respectively. CLIC uses a two-beam acceleration scheme, in which 12 GHz accelerating structures are powered via a high-current drive beam. For the first stage, an alternative with X-band klystron powering is also considered. CLIC accelerator optimisation, technical developments and system tests have resulted in an increased energy efficiency (power around 170 MW) for the 380 GeV stage, together with a reduced cost estimate at the level of 6 billion CHF.","tags":["Accelerator Physics"],"title":"The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC)-2018 Summary Report","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A processing sketch and some bash scripts to get a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot to mimic arm movements.

In order to focus on a well defined and controlled case, we have built a small dataset of movie scenes from three sequel movies. In addition, manual annotations have led to a ground-truth similarity matrix between the adopted scenes. Then, three similarity matrices (one for each medium) have been computed based on Gaussian Mixture Models (audio and visual) and Latent Semantic Indexing (text). We have evaluated the automatically extracted similarities along with two simple fusion approaches and results indicate that the low-level features can lead to an accurate representation of the movie content. In addition, the fusion approach seems to outperform the individual modalities, which is a strong indication that individual modules lead to diverse similarities (in terms of content). Finally, we have evaluated the extracted similarities for different groups of human annotators, based on what a human interprets as similar and the results show that different groups of people correlate better with different modalities. This last result is very important and can be either used in (a) a personalized content-based retrieval and recommender system and (b) in a local weighted fusion approach, in future research.","tags":["Feature extraction","Motion pictures","Visualization","Multimedia communication","Recommender systems"],"title":"Discovering Similarities for Content-Based Recommendation and Browsing in Multimedia Collections","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/my-website/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/my-website/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
